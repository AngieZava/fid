<h2>Facts:</h2>
<h3>The zebra finch is the most common estrildid finch of Central Australia and ranges over most of the continent, avoiding only the cool moist south and some areas of the tropical far north. It can also be found natively on Timor island. The bird has been introduced to Puerto Rico and Portugal.<br>
</h3>
<h2>Care and Feeding:</h2>
<h3>Apart from a cage or an aviary, you will need some pots for food and a drinker for water. Since zebra finches like to bathe, you should also have something for them to bathe in. If you are hoping for chicks, you should also get a nestbox (around 12 x 12 x 12 cm) or a wicker nest.
