<h2>Facts:</h2><br>
<h3>Conures are a diverse, loosely defined group of small to medium-sized parrots. They belong to several genera within a long-tailed group of the New World parrot subfamily Arinae. The term "conure" is used primarily in bird keeping, though it has appeared in some scientific journals.<br>
</h3>
<h2>Care and Feeding:</h2><br>
<h3>Conures generally love to bathe â€” in their water dish, in the shower with their owner or via a spray bath. A conure's diet should include a nutritionally balanced manufactured diet, supplemented with fresh vegetables, fruit and healthy table foods. Conures have busy beaks, which makes Lafeber foods a conure favorite.
